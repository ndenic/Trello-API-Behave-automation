# Assignment 1: Getting familiar with API calls
## Description

For this assignment you'll use SaaS Trello that was our first module that we made.   
For the first assigment you need to get the boards of an organization (Workspace) create/fill a dataclass from the data gotten from the API and just print out the data or save it into a .txt file.

### Simple Trello resource structure:
- Organization (Workspace) can have many Boards.
- Boards have one or more Lists and Labels.
- Lists have Cards
- Cards have Comments, Checklists and Attachments

## You can also populate created board resources with children resources using Trello API and get that data as well.

## Create a Gherkin feature file with scenario and steps that will call the methods you created to perform previously described actions.
